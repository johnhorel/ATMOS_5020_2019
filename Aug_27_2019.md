# Log onto the CHPC computer `meteo07.chpc.utah.edu`

    ssh -l uXXXXXXX -Y meteo07.chpc.utah.edu

And then `cd` into your `public_html/5020` directory.

# Running Linux commands with shell scripts
Often, we want to execute commands more than once and have a record of how we did it.

When a group of commands has to be executed regularly, we can store them in a file and execute those commands from the file. Such files are called **shell scripts**, **shell programs**, or **shell procedures**.

There is no restrictions on file extension, but to denote a tcsh-shell script it is best to use the extension `.csh`.

Copy a shell script to your directory

    cp ~u0035056/public_html/5020/first.csh .


    # Remember the format of this copy command is...
    cp <what do you want to copy> <where do you want to copy>

Look in this file
- `more first.csh`
- `chmod +x first.csh` (what does this do?)
- `./first.csh` (what happened?)
    - Note: The `./` indicates to look for the scrip in the current directory.

No compiler is required to run a shell script, because the UNIX shell acts as an interpreter when reading script files.

After you create a shell script, you simply tell the OS that the file is a program that can be executed, by using the `chmod` command to change the file's mode to be executable.

Shell programs are slower than compiled programs, because the shell must interpret each UNIX command inside the executable script file before it is executed.

A tsch shell script must begin with the line

    #!/bin/tcsh

<br><br>
# Looking at web cam images
Go to  http://home.chpc.utah.edu/~u0790486/wxinfo/cgi-bin/uunet_camera_explorer.cgi

Click on the image and look at the web page location: http://meso1.chpc.utah.edu/station_cameras/wbbw_cam/wbbw_cam_current.jpg

We want to save those images and post on a web page.

Copy a scripts from the class directory to your own `public_html` class directory

    cp ~u0035056/public_html/5020/camera.csh .
    chmod +x camera.csh
    ./camera.csh

What happened?

Look at the script...

    more camera.csh

# Examining the shell script
Grabbing camera images: `camera.csh`. Pay attention to the _semantics_ and _syntax_ unique to a shell script.

|||
|--|--|
|`#!/bin/tcsh`| indicates computer to use the tcsh shell (not bash). This is always the first line.
|`set ctr = 0`| assign a value of 0 to ctr (counter)
|`# going to loop 3 times`| `#` indicates a comment. The text that follows on this line is not code.
|`while ( $ctr < 3 )`|  loop while ctr is less than 3 (0,1,2)
|```set file = wbbw_`date -u +%Y%m%d%H%M%S`.jpg```| we are using the date function in a specific time string format and set the variable file to a string
|`echo grabbing wbbw image no $ctr`| writing to the terminal before getting the image
|`curl "http://meso1.chpc.utah.edu/station_cameras/wbbw_cam/wbbw_cam_current.jpg" -o $file`| using the function curl to get the image from a directory and save it to a file named file1. Type `man curl` to see what curl is about.
|`sleep 10`| wait 10 seconds before grabbing the next image
|`@ ctr++`| increment the counter from 0 to 1 to 2 and then it'll stop
|`end`| the end of the while loop



## Look in your web directory using a browser
- http://home.chpc.utah.edu/~uXXXXXXX/5020/
    - Replace the X‚Äôs with your unid
- What is in your directory now?

# Let‚Äôs do something!
How do you switch in the shell script to the Bonneville Salt Flat camera?
- Go to: http://home.chpc.utah.edu/~u0790486/wxinfo/cgi-bin/uunet_camera_explorer.cgi
- Shift to the BFLAT camera and then click to the image
- What needs to be changed about the `curl` line in terms of the directory and file name?

## Editing files in Unix
- Choice:
  - edit on remote server that you will be running the program or‚Ä¶
  - edit on local computer and upload or run the program remotely from your local computer
- Choice:
  `vim` (NOT WYSWYG) vs. `emacs` or `gedit`: arguments galore on the ‚Äúbest‚Äù editor
- vim - proper indents for python, etc.
- Lots of other powerful editors (VS Code, Atom, brackets, etc.)
- Your choice - vim is old school, but always there

### VIM or VI (old school)
- `vim` session begins by invoking the command ‚Äúvim‚Äù with or without a filename. 
    - To open the script, type `vim cameras.csh` in the terminal
    - Alternatively, type `vim` and then open a file by typing `:e cameras.csh`. 
- Each line led with ~
- Two modes: Command Mode and Insert Mode.
- Last line in the screen reserved for commands that you can enter commands to act on the text as well as used by the system to display messages.
- Refer to this cheat sheet if you want to give `vim` a try: https://www.chpc.utah.edu/presentations/vi_CheatSheet-2.pdf

### Little better...
`gedit` or `emacs` provide a GUI interface. If x11 is enabled (you logged onto the machine with the -Y option), open an editor by typing

    gedit



### Modern Editors (newer school)
Lots of options out there. We will use VSCode in class (we installed this the first day).

Let‚Äôs edit the script on your Mac, not on the meteo07 computer.
- **Type `exit` to log out of the meteo07 and be back on your local mac.**
- Download the camera.csh file from your web page to your mac into your Desktop directory
- Open the file in VSCode
- Change the line:
  - `curl "http://meso1.chpc.utah.edu/station_cameras/wbbw_cam/wbbw_cam_current.jpg" -o $file`
- To
  - `curl "http://meso1.chpc.utah.edu/station_cameras/bflat_cam/bflat_cam_current.jpg" -o $file`
- Save the file as `camera_bflat.csh`
- Run the script from the terminal (you should be on your local Mac)
`./camera_bflat.csh`
- Did it work? Do you have camera images in your Desktop directory?
- Now change the assignment of the name of the camera images from `wbb_w` to `bflat`

# üîÅ Copying a file to your Linux `public_html` directory from your Mac

We want to copy `camera_bflat.csh` to your `public_html/5020` directory in your CHPC account. The `scp` command stands for "secure copy." 

    scp camera_bflat.csh uXXXXXXX@meteo07.chpc.utah.edu:public_html/5020

The format is

    scp file_to_transfer logonID@computerName.chpc.utah.edu:path/relative/to/home

- Verify by looking in your CHPC public_html account (use commands like `cd public_html` and `ls`) that the file you copied is there.
- Go to your meteo07 terminal window (via `ssh`) and run the camera_bflat.csh script
  - `./camera_bflat.csh`
` Go to your web page (chpc.utah.edu/~uXXXXXX/5020) and view the images.
