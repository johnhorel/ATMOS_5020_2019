The entrance is on the east side of the building. By design, the front door is hard to find.

As of last year, this is what the entrance looked like...

# Why are we going?
The Downtown Data Center is where the University of Utah, University Hospital, and the Center For High Performance Computing (CHPC) house their computer resources. Many research groups at the university, including all the atmospheric science research groups, do their work on these computers. When you log onto `meteo07@chpc.utah.edu`, you are accessing one of many computers located at this facility.

During the tour, you will see the computer you log into for class, see lots of wires and flashing lights, and learn a little about how a supercomputer facility works. Be ready to ask questions and soak in the knowledge!
