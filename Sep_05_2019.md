# Code blocks and indentation
Type the following three lines. Pay careful attention to the number of spaces in lines 2 and 3:

    for i in range(0,5):
        x = i*2
        print(x)

> ## Question: What does this code do?

This is known as a **for loop**. It iterates, or repeats, the same code within the indented block many times for changing values of `i`.

The first line initializes the **for loop**. The syntax to start a **for loop** is `for [variable] in [sequence of objects]:`. The indented code block that follows executes once for changing values of `i`.

The value of `i` changes by the sequence `range(0,5)`. Type `help(range)` to read what range does, then type `q` to exit the help document. 

During each loop, the value of `i` is assigned 0, 1, 2, 3, and then 4 (the last number, 5, is excluded, as described in the help documents). To see what `range()` does, type `range(0,5)` and then type `list(range(0,5))`.

The `:` at the end of the first line is necessary and indicates that a code block follows. Note that each line in the code block is indented exactly 4 spaces. This indentation syntax make Python code more readable.

The second line multiplies the current value of `i` by `2` and assigns the value to the variable `x`.

On the third line, the function `print()` takes the input and writes it to the screen. In this case, it prints the value of `x`.

The loop continues until all the items in `range(0,5)` are exhausted.

In other words, "For each value of `i` ranging from zero to five, assign `x` to `i*2`. Then print the new value of `x`."

    # For Loop Syntax
    for [variable] in [sequence]:
        [do something]

[Reference: Python For Loop](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python3/python_for_loop.htm)

> ## Do it yourself
> Write another _for loop_ that does something different. Consider the following examples:

    for i in 'letters':
        print("Give me a letter:", i)

    for i in ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']:
        print("Fruit:", i)







>## NOTE: Python is object-oriented
>Everything is an object. This makes coding very flexible but can also be confusing.  
>
>You can look at the attributes and methods of any variable or object by executing the `dir()` function.
> Example: 
>
>> `a = 4`  
>> `dir(a)`  
>
>We'll tend to use Python in a procedural-programming context that should minimize the confusion.

## Anaconda Launcher
Find and open the Anaconda Launcher and pin it to the dock if you haven't already. This GUI will help you manage software packages we will add another day. To see what is already installed, click then `Environments` label on the side and scroll through the installed packages. If you were to install Python from the Python website, it wouldn't have installed all these other useful tools. Anaconda helps manage these packages.

## Install extra packages
There are a lot of ways to set up custom environments, but we will keep things simple for this class. 

First, let's install some additional packages we will use later.
- Go the the Environments tab and edit the channels.
    - Add `conda-forge` to the channel.
- Now search for `metpy`. This is a package that includes some meteorological tools. Select that.
- Also search for `netcdf4` and select that.
- Click "Apply" at the bottom right corner. Anaconda will check the packages and for any dependancies it requires. Notice that Anaconda is installing a package called `xarray` and `cartopy`. 
    - NOTE: We might need to install `netcdf4` via the command line because it doesn't work in the navigator.





## 1. Practice writing loops and lists

- Write a Python loop that sums all the numbers in a list.
- Write a Python loop that finds the smallest value of a list.
