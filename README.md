## üíª Setting Up Your Personal Computer
**Log-on to CHPC:** If you are a windows user and you want to log onto the CHPC resources, you must [install Putty and Xming and follow these instructions for logging in](https://github.com/johnhorel/ATMOS_5020_2019/blob/master/supplemental_docs/putty.md). Mac users can use the terminal like we do in the classroom.

**Install Python:** The recommended way to install Python on your personal computer is with the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) distribution service. 
- You can install packages with the Anaconda Navigator tool in the "Environments" tab.
- Brian's instructions give a few more details to [install Python with Anaconda on your personal computer](https://github.com/johnhorel/ATMOS_5020_2019/blob/master/supplemental_docs/install_anaconda_windows.md)
- The [Unidata workshop](https://github.com/Unidata/unidata-users-workshop) also has some instructions on how to set up your environment.
- We also recommend you install a good text editor like VSCode.

### üêç Learn Python 
The purpose of this class is to introduce you to programming principles. Your programming skill will only improve after hours and hours of practice. If you plan on using Python after this class, it is _highly recommended_ that you learn from other resources. There are several free Python learning courses that will really help you learn Python, like [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3). The [Unidata training](http://unidata.github.io/online-python-training/) is another useful resource.
