## üíª Setting up on your personal computer.
**Log-on to CHPC:** If you are a windows user and you want to log onto the CHPC resources, you must [install Putty and Xming and follow these instructions for logging in](https://github.com/johnhorel/ATMOS_5020_2019/blob/master/supplemental_docs/putty.md). Mac users can use the terminal like we do in the classroom.

**Install Python:** The recommended way to install Python on your personal computer is with the Anaconda distribution service. The Unidata training is _highly recommended_, especially if you will use Python after this class.

- Brian's instructions give a few more details to [install Python with Anaconda on your personal computer](https://github.com/johnhorel/ATMOS_5020_2019/blob/master/supplemental_docs/install_anaconda_windows.md)
- The [Unidata workshop](https://github.com/Unidata/unidata-users-workshop) also has some instructions on how to set up your environment.

There are several free learning courses that will really help you get a jump-start on learning python.
