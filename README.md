## How to view Jupyter Notebooks
Notebooks _should_ render on Github. If they don't you can copy the notebook URL and and view it with the nbviewer: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/.

Alternatively, download the notebook by right clicking the 'raw' button and selecting 'save as' and then open the notebook in Jupyter Lab.
