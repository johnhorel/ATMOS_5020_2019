# Computer Binary
Computers know only about strings of 0 and 1
- Bits: Binary digITs (two bits: 0 or 1)
- Byte: 8 bits
- 32 or 64 bit words
- Combinations of bytes and words often expressed as hexidecimals (base 16)
- Computers count with bits; humans use base 10
- Computer program is required to translate from/to base 10

## Numbers as bits

|Integer|Bit String|Equation|
|--|--|--|
|0|0|(0 x 2<sup>0</sup>)|
|1|1|(1 x 2<sup>0</sup>)|
|2|10|(1 x 2<sup>1</sup>) + (0 x 2<sup>0</sup>)|
|3|11|(1 x 2<sup>1</sup>) + (1 x 2<sup>0</sup>)|
|4|100|(1 x 2<sup>2</sup>) + (0 x 2<sup>1</sup>) + (0 x 2<sup>0</sup>)|
|5|101|(1 x 2<sup>2</sup>) + (0 x 2<sup>1</sup>) + (1 x 2<sup>0</sup>)|
|6|110|(1 x 2<sup>2</sup>) + (1 x 2<sup>1</sup>) + (0 x 2<sup>0</sup>)|

## ASCII Character Codes
Languages tend to use a similar syntax. Characters are represented by 8 bit (1 byte) strings defined by the _American Standard Code for Information Interchange_. http://www.ascii-code.com/

|Word| Binary| Binary Values|
|--|--|--|
|Dog|`01000100 01101111 01100111`| 68 111 103|
|Cat|`01000011 01100001 01110100`| 67 97 116|
|python|`01110000 01111001 01110100 01101000 01101111 01101110`| 112 121 116 104 111 110| 

### **How do you know whether a bit string represents a number or a character?**
This is interpreted by the program you are using. Each language defines syntax for different types of “variables” or “data types” e.g. character, integer, float. 

A variable of data type “character” can be assigned a length so that a 20 character variable is `20 characters * 8 bits/character= 160 bits`

- Some languages require you to "declare" the variable's type (Fortran, C, etc.).
- In Python, variable declaration is dynamic and the program will decide for you. (This is a convenient advantage of Python)
    - 10 is an integer. Binary: `1010`
    - 10.625 is a float. Binary: `1010.101`
    - "10.3" is a character. Binary (ascii) `00110001 00110000 00101110 00110011`

<br><br>
# Programming languages
Programming is a way to pass a list of instructions to a computer. Each language has its own syntax (form) and semantics (meaning).
- **Syntax**: Sequences of text including words, numbers, and punctuation using rules like written languages. The "grammar rules" for that language.
- **Semantics**: The meaning given to the syntax - a sequence of words that makes sense to a computer. The symbol `!` or `^` can mean different things in different languages. 

## Compiled vs. Interpreted Languages
### Compiled
- Translates the language syntax (source code) to machine code (binary) before executing the program.
- Create a binary executable that is “run”
- `C` and `Fortran` are examples of compiled languages
- Compiled codes typically take less time to complete
- Usually requires recompiling on different platforms: Linux vs. PC

### Interpreted
- Executes source code directly translating statements using code snippets already compiled in machine language.
- Create and run a script that executes instructions
- `Java`, `Python`, `Perl`, and `Julia` are examples of interpreted languages
- Tend to be slower but also more platform independent. (You can run python code you write on the Mac on your PC as long as you have the correct Python interpreter installed).

# Linux commands (review)
Perhaps one of the most repeated tasks in programing is to get data files, move data files, copy data files, remove data files, change data files, etc. That is why we are spending so much time learning how to move and manipulate files in Linux (you want to develop the muscle memory).

Linux commands follow the pattern

    <command> <options or "flags"> <directory or file>

For example, to list all the files in a specific directory and to show more information about those files...

    ls ./myDirectory/
    ls -l ./myDirectory/

## Copy and move files

|||
|--|--|
|`cp file1 file2`|  copies file1 to file2
|`cp file1 dest_directory/`|  copy file1 to the specified existing directory
|`cp * dest_directory/`|     Copy all files in current directory to dest
|`cp -r directory1 dest_directory/`|   Recursively copies files from directory1 to the dest_directory
|`mv file1 new-file`|         renames file1 as new-file
|`mv file1 dest_directory/`|  moves file1 to the specified existing directory


## Removing files and directories

**There is no undelete! Be careful!!!**

|||
|--|--|
|`rm fileName`| Remove a file. **Cannot be undone!** |
|`rm -i file`| Interactive removal (option –i) of specified file. User must answer yes or no before deletion.
|`rm -r directoryName`| Don't DO THIS! Unless you know what you are doing. A recursive deletion of all files within the specified directories and the directory

## Path Navigation

|||
|--|--|
|`pwd`| Tells you were you are at.|
|`/`|Separates directories|
|`.`| refers to the current directory. Example: `cp /this/File.txt ./`|
|`..`| refers to parent directory (back one). Example: `cd ../../myDir`
|`*`| Wildcard. For example, list all files ending in .txt: `ls *.txt`

> Pro Tips:
> 1. Use the up and down arrows to look at old commands.
> 1. Use the tap key to auto-complete directory or file names that exist.


<br><br>
# Linux User Permissions
Linux machines allow multiple people to use them. Permissions define who has access to the files. 

Linux distinguishes permission for three different types.
- `u`: **User** This is "you." (Type `whoami` to see who you are)
- `g`: **Group** The group is anyone related to your organization (Check with `groups`).
- `o`: **Others** This is anyone with access to the Linux system.

Each type can have privileges to read (r) write (w) and execute (x).
- `r`: Read privileges. Can you see the contents of the file.
- `w`: Write privileges. Can you edit the contents of the file.
- `x`: Execute privileges. Can you use the file to execute commands or run a program script?

<img src='./images/permission-structure.png' align=right style='padding:30px'>

Check permissions with `ls –l`

- `drwxrwxrwx` (directory, user-group-other all have read, write, and execute privileges)
- `-rwx------` (file and only the user can rwx the file)
- `-r--r--r--` (file with only read permissions for everyone)

 Use the `chmod` ("change mode") command to change file permission.

|Examples||
|--|--|
|`chmod +x fileName`|  Gives yourself execute permissions on a file
|`chmod ugo +rwx fileName`|  Gives everyone (user, group and others) permission to read, write, and execute file
|`chmod o -wx fileName`| Remove permission by all others to write or execute a file.

# Now we are going to access a different computer

<p style='text-align:center'><img src='./images/DDC_computers.png'>

The Center for High-Performance Computing ([CHPC](https://www.chpc.utah.edu/)) offers many resources not available on these classroom computers. This section will show you how to access CHPC resources. Today you will create a new directory accessible on the CHPC web server.

## Log onto a CHPC computer: `meteo07`

 In the terminal, type the following:

    ssh –l uXXXXXXX –Y meteo07.chpc.utah.edu

- `ssh` means to secure login to a remote computer.
- `-l` specifies the "user" option (replace the Xs with your unid)
- The `–Y` option allows secure x11 forwarding for graphics

> NOTE: When you type your password, the cursor won't move or type *, it will stay blank. If you think you messed up, hold the backspace key for a while then start again. Then type `yes` when/if prompted to do so (first time you log in).

(You may also log into `meteo08.chpc.utah.edu`)

You just logged onto a different computer located at the University's Downtown Data Center. This is a Linux system. 


<p style='text-align:center'><img src='./images/ssh.png' width=500>

Type `pwd` to see where you are at.

> 👀 TRY THIS! Type `xeyes` and hit enter. Do a pair of eyes pop up? This is a quick test to see if X11 is working. X11 enables you to see graphics on your screen from the remote computer.



## Make a Public HTML Directory

1. Make a new directory called `public_html`.
    - `mkdir public_html`
1. Go to that directory
    - `cd public_html`
1. Make a directory called `5020` and cd into it.
    - `mkdir 5020`
    - `cd 5020`
1. Copy a file of precipitation data from Utah
    - `cp ~u0035056/public_html/5020/utah_precip_oct.csv .`
      - the `.` at the end indicates the directory I am currently in
      - The syntax you are using to copy the file: `cp [file from here] [put it here]`
    - **What did you just do?**
1. Look in your new web directory using a browser
    - **http://home.chpc.utah.edu/~uXXXXXXX/**
        - Replace the X’s with your unid
    - What is there now in your directory?
    - Files you put in this `public_html` directory--like images, HTML, etc.--are accessible by you and others by the web.

> ## 🤚 "I need a reminder of how to log onto the CHPC computer!" Follow the instructions above and follow this YouTube tutorial, _Logging Onto CHPC resources_: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hP2GDWCTKg4

> ## 🤚 **How do I log onto CHPC resources on my Windows PC?** [Use Putty and Xming](./supplemental_docs/putty.md).
---

## E5: I want to
1. Look at the precipitation data from Utah from Oct 1-9, 2018
    - `more utah_precip_oct.csv`
    - type `q` or `ctrl-c` to exit out of `more`.
1. Sort the file so that the highest values are at the top and save the output to utah_precip_oct_sort.csv
    - `sort –r utah_precip_oct.csv > utah_precip_oct_sort.csv`
        - Is it sorted correctly?
        - What does the `–r` modifier do?
- Try this:
  - `sort –r -g utah_precip_oct.csv > utah_precip_oct_sort.csv`
  - Is that better? Why?
  - Do a `man sort` to read the documents.

# Running linux commands with shell scripts


Often, we want to execute commands more than once and have a record of how we did it.

When a group of commands has to be executed regularly, we can store them in a file and execute those commands from the file. Such files are called **shell scripts**, **shell programs**, or **shell procedures**.

There is no restrictions on file extension, but to denote a tcsh-shell script it is best to use the extension `.csh`.

Copy a shell script to your directory

    cp ~u0035056/public_html/5020/first.csh .

Look in this file
- `more first.csh`
- `chmod +x first.csh` (what does this do?)
- `./first.csh` (what happened?)
    - The `./` indicates to look for the scrip in the current directory.


No compiler is required to run a shell script, because the UNIX shell acts as an interpreter when reading script files.

After you create a shell script, you simply tell the OS that the file is a program that can be executed, by using the `chmod` command to change the file's mode to be executable.

Shell programs are slower than compiled programs, because the shell must interpret each UNIX command inside the executable script file before it is executed.

# Looking at web cam images
Go to  http://home.chpc.utah.edu/~u0790486/wxinfo/cgi-bin/uunet_camera_explorer.cgi

Click on the image and look at the web page location: http://meso1.chpc.utah.edu/station_cameras/wbbw_cam/wbbw_cam_current.jpg

We want to save those images and post on a web page.

Copy a scripts from the class directory to your own `public_html` class directory

    cp ~u0035056/public_html/5020/camera.csh .
    chmod +x camera.csh
    more camera.csh
    ./camera.csh

What happened?

# Examining the shell script
Grabbing camera images: `camera.csh`. Pay attention to the _semantics_ and _syntax_ unique to a shell script.

|||
|--|--|
|`#!/bin/tcsh`| indicates computer to use the tcsh shell (not bash)
|`set ctr = 0`| assign a value of 0 to ctr (counter)
|`#going to loop 3 times`| `#` indicates a comment
|`while ( $ctr < 3 )`|  loop while ctr is less than 3 (0,1,2)
|```set file = wbbw_`date -u +%Y%m%d%H%M%S`.jpg```| we are using the date function in a specific time string format and set the variable file to a string
|`echo grabbing wbbw image no $ctr`| writing to the terminal before getting the image
|`curl "http://meso1.chpc.utah.edu/station_cameras/wbbw_cam/wbbw_cam_current.jpg" -o $file`| using the function curl to get the image from a directory and save it to a file named file1. Type `man curl` to see what curl is about.
|`sleep 10`| wait 10 seconds before grabbing the next image
|`@ ctr++`| increment the counter from 0 to 1 to 2 and then it'll stop
|`end`| the end of the while loop



# Look in your web directory using a browser
- http://home.chpc.utah.edu/~uXXXXXXX/5020/
    - Replace the X’s with your unid
- What is in your directory now?

# Let’s do something!
How do you switch in the shell script to the Bonneville Salt Flat camera?
- Go to: http://home.chpc.utah.edu/~u0790486/wxinfo/cgi-bin/uunet_camera_explorer.cgi
- Shift to the BFLAT camera and then click to the image
- What needs to be changed about the `curl` line in terms of the directory and file name?

# Editing files in Unix
- Choice:
  - edit on remote server that you will be running the program or…
  - edit on local computer and upload or run the program remotely from your local computer
- Choice:
  `vim` (NOT WYSWYG) vs. `emacs` or `gedit`: arguments galore on the “best” editor
- vim - proper indents for python, etc.
- Lots of other powerful editors (VS Code, Atom, brackets, etc.)
- Your choice - vim is old school, but always there

## VIM or VI (old school)
- `vim` session begins by invoking the command “vim” with or without a filename. 
    - To open the script, type `vim cameras.csh` in the terminal
    - Alternatively, type `vim` and then open a file by typing `:e cameras.csh`. 
- Each line led with ~
- Two modes: Command Mode and Insert Mode.
- Last line in the screen reserved for commands that you can enter commands to act on the text as well as used by the system to display messages.
- Refer to this cheat sheet if you want to give `vim` a try: https://www.chpc.utah.edu/presentations/vi_CheatSheet-2.pdf

## Little better...
- `gedit` or `emacs` provide a GUI interface.

## Modern Editors (newer school)
Lots of options out there. We will use VSCode in class (we installed this the first day). 


---

Let’s edit the script on your Mac, not on the meteo07 computer.
- **Type `exit` to log out of the meteo07 and be back on your local mac.**
- Download the camera.csh file from your web page to your mac into your Desktop directory
- Open the file in VSCode
- Change the line:
  - `curl "http://meso1.chpc.utah.edu/station_cameras/wbbw_cam/wbbw_cam_current.jpg" -o $file`
- To
  - `curl "http://meso1.chpc.utah.edu/station_cameras/bflat_cam/bflat_cam_current.jpg" -o $file`
- Save the file as `camera_bflat.csh`
- Run the script in from the terminal
`./camera_bflat.csh`
- Did it work? Do you have camera images in your Desktop directory?
- Now change the assignment of the name of the camera images from `wbb_w` to `bflat`

<br><br>

# 🔁 Copying a file to your Linux `public_html` directory from your Mac

We want to copy `camera_bflat.csh` to your `public_html/5020` directory in your CHPC account. The `scp` command stands for "secure copy." 

    scp camera_bflat.csh uXXXXXXX@meteo07.chpc.utah.edu:public_html/5020

The format is

    scp file_to_transfer logonID@computerName.chpc.utah.edu:path/relative/to/home

- Verify by looking in your CHPC public_html account (use commands like `cd public_html` and `ls`) that the file you copied is there.
- Go to your meteo07 terminal window (via `ssh`) and run the camera_bflat.csh script
  - `./camera_bflat.csh`
` Go to your web page (chpc.utah.edu/~uXXXXXX/5020) and view the images.
